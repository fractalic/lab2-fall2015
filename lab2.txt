## Code style and smells
What is good, bad, confusing about the code? Focus only on `Main.java` and `UBCPoet.java`.

Good:
* UBCPoet references previous work and includes an @author tag.
* Variable names are descriptive.
* No unnecessary global variables.
* `main` function has a comment with a specification.

Bad:
* No specification (javadoc) on any member functions.
* `pick` function can return null.
* `eloquent` function relies on `pick` returning null.

Confusing:
* There's no indication that the poem will be random, except near the very last line of the file.

## The First-Line Bug

The first-line bug is not a bug in a code, but a limitation of
the English language (or at least this particular description
of it). This code looks up the definition of a given word,
and replaces each word in the definition with something clever.
The word "a", which has no hyponyms and a single hypernym --
"metric linear unit" -- will be replaced by "metric linear unit"
everywhere it appears, according to this algorithm.

As the word "a" is frequent in definitions, it is desirable
to rework the poem generation to reduce the frequency of the
output phrase "metric linear unit".

## The Out-of-Bounds Bug

The `alliterations` function checks for words that start with
the same two letters and end with the same last letter.
This function relies on the given word containing at least two
letters, which many words in this dictionary do not.
The definition of "gun" contains many words which have either
hypernyms or hyponyms exactly one letter long. When these words
are passed to `alliterations`, the Exception occurs.


## The Illegal Argument Bug

The string returned by the dictionary lookup is split at all
non-word characters (such as punctuation and whitespace).
When two of these characters occur next to each other, the
resulting list of words will contain an empty string.
The spec of the getIndexWord function states that it
must not be called on an empty string, so our program
should verify that the word is non-empty
