## Code style and smells
What is good, bad, confusing about the code? Focus only on `Main.java` and `UBCPoet.java`.

Good:
* UBCPoet references previous work and includes an @author tag.
* Variable names are descriptive.

Bad:
* No comments (javadocs) on any member functions.
* `pick` can return null.
